Platform Engineer with a history of working in the information technology and services industry. I have extensive experience in Software & Platform Engineering; I have shown interest in this industry from the age of 13 and I've been lucky enough to have the experience to broaden my knowledge and confidence ever since. I have a genuine interest in the cloud native landscape with 4+ years of experience in Kubernetes and Cloud infrastructure.
